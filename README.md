## K-Means Clustering Project

### Overview
This project involves creating a K-means clustering algorithm to group customers of a retail store based on their purchase history.

### Data
The dataset, ‘Mall_Customers.csv’, includes customer details such as Gender, Age, Annual Income, and Spending Score.

### Methodology
Data Selection: Features for clustering were selected from the dataset.
Elbow Method: Used to determine the optimal number of clusters.
K-Means Clustering: Applied with 5 clusters to segment the customers.

### Results
Elbow Plot: Visual representation to show the within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS).
Cluster Pairplot: Displays data distribution among the clusters.
Box Plots: Illustrate statistical summaries for Annual Income and Spending Score.
Cluster Visualization: Scatter plot showing customer groups with cluster centroids.

### Usage
To run the clustering analysis, import the necessary libraries and follow the steps outlined in the Jupyter Notebook.
